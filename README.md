### Lessons Learned
Applying composite keys in this database was an excellent exercise in understanding higherlevel 'trade-off's'. Using composite keys was the most appropriate way to map relationships however doing so created chalenges such as using seralizable entities and managing JSON recrusion. We also learned to effictively build and apply a pipe for calculating the winning team in a league. Implementing a secirity layer which allows for encrypted authorizaiton was also applied in this project. Some data that would be visible to any user reauired a simple but additional step of 'creating a hole' in the security layer.
